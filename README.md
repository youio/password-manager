# password-manager
welcome to my self-contained, command-line password manager. 
The C++ program generates a random password that is 10 characters long and guaranteed to have a number, a symbol and an upper and lower case character.
The bash scripts automate inserting and retreiving the password from the storage file.
The aliases wrap the bash scripts so you can call them from anywhere in the command line without needing to type out the path.
